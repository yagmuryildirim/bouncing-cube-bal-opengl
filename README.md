# comp410-bouncingcube-ball
Comp410 - Project 1

For this project, I implemented a basic graphics application of a bouncing cube and ball using shader based OpenGL and GLUT.
There are 2 object types: a cube and a ball.
There are color options: black, white, red, blue, yellow and green
There are 2 drawing modes: solid and wireframe
There are 3 key presses: i for initializing the object, h for help for commands, q for quitting
